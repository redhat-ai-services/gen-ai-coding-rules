# gen-ai-coding-rules

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of rules and best practices for configuring AI coding tools such as GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and Cursor. The goal is to ensure high-quality, secure, and maintainable code generation across a variety of languages, frameworks, and project types.

These rules are primarily developed and curated by Red Hat consultants, particularly those in the AI practice, drawing on real-world experience from enterprise and open source projects.

These instructions:

- Include best practices for code generation, security, performance, and documentation
- Are tailored for various programming languages and frameworks, ensuring consistency and quality in generated code
- Follow a conventional format for commit message generation to maintain clarity and structure in version control history
- Enable code search functionality for better navigation and understanding of the codebase
- Are designed to enhance the development experience and ensure adherence to coding standards across projects
- Cover a wide range of scenarios from enterprise applications to small projects, ensuring that the generated code is appropriate for the context in which it will be used
- Emphasize the use of environment variables, configuration validation, and deployment best practices to ensure secure and efficient application development
- Are structured to allow easy updates and additions as new best practices or requirements emerge in the development landscape
- Are intended to be used in a collaborative environment where multiple developers may contribute to the same codebase, ensuring that everyone follows the same guidelines
- Serve as a reference for developers to understand the expectations for code quality, security, and performance
- Can be customized further based on specific project requirements or team preferences

We are happy to accept thoughtful pull requests, suggestions, and edits from the community. Please help us improve and keep these guidelines aligned with the latest industry standards and practices.
