# Alex's (thinko's) Gen-AI Coding Rules

## Overview

This repository documents the personal coding rules and best practices established by Alex Handy for use with AI coding assistants, including GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, and Cursor. These rules are designed to ensure high-quality, secure, maintainable, and consistent code generation across different editors and environments, with a particular focus on the Visual Studio Code and Cursor IDEs.

The documented guidelines cover:

- Version and dependency management
- Project context detection and alignment
- Code quality, architecture, and documentation standards
- Security, performance, and error handling best practices
- Logging, resilience, and testing strategies
- API, frontend, and configuration conventions
- DevOps, containerization, and commit message guidelines

These rules reflect Alex's preferred approaches and are intended to guide AI-powered code suggestions, reviews, and automation in both personal and collaborative projects.

These rules are not exhaustive and may evolve over time as new tools, practices, and technologies emerge. They are meant to be a living document that adapts to the changing landscape of software development and AI-assisted coding. Please use them as a starting point and adapt them to your specific project needs and team practices. I bear no liability or warranty, and will not be held responsible if these rules allow your dog to run away or get your cat stuck in a tree. YMMV.
